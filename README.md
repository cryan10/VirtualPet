# VirtualPet
App that creates a customized dog and lets the user interact and bond with their digital pet.

First, the app asks the user to name their dog and describe what the dog looks like. Depending on the size of the dog indicated by the user, the user will see a customized image of their new furry friend. Next, the user will get to ask the pet a question to bond. Finally, the user will have the opportunity to check in on their dog's needs, and see if they need to do anything to take care of the dog.
